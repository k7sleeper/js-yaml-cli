JavaScript YAML Command-line Utilities
======================================

Command-line utilities to convert [YAML](http://yaml.org/) files to JSON files and vice versa.

js-yaml-cli is based on [js-yaml](http://github.com/nodeca/js-yaml)
and provides a more sophisticated command-line interface 
than that one [js-yaml](http://github.com/nodeca/js-yaml) comes along with.

js-yaml-cli runs under [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/).

## Installing js-yaml-cli

js-yaml-cli depends on [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [npm](http://npmjs.org/). It's
installed globally using npm:

```
npm install -g js-yaml-cli
```
